      <H3><SPAN class=text><B>Why Mulch?</B></SPAN></H3>
      <P><SPAN class=text>Agriculture with mulch in the tropics promotes plant 
      health and vigor. Mulching improves nutrient and water retention in the 
      soil, encourages favorable soil microbial activity and worms, and 
      suppresses weed growth. When properly executed, mulching can significantly 
      improve the well-being of plants and reduce maintenance as compared to 
      bare soil culture. Mulched plants have better vigor and, consequently have 
      improved resistance to pests and diseases.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN class=text>"Mulch" is a layer of decaying organic matter on the 
      ground. Mulch occurs naturally in all forests; it is a nutrient rich, 
      moisture absorbent bed of decaying forest leaves, twigs and branches, 
      teeming with fungal, microbial and insect life. Natural mulch serves as a 
      "nutrient bank," storing the nutrients contained in organic matter and 
      slowly making these nutrients available to plants. All forms of plant life 
      from the ground layer to shrubs and trees thrive, grow, shed organic 
      matter, die and decay, in a complicated cycle of nutrients.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN class=text>Mulch forms a necessary link in nutrient cycling vital 
      for our soils. When mulch is absent for whatever reason, the living soil 
      is robbed of its natural nutrient stores, becomes leached and often 
      desiccates. Natural environments without a litter layer are usually 
      deserts. Non-desert plants grown in bare soil require constant 
      fertilization, nutrient amendment and water, not to mention the work 
      required to keep the soil bare.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN class=text>Sheet mulching as described here is a suggested method 
      for controlling weeds and improving soil and plant health with mulch. The 
      process mimics the litter layer of a forest floor.</SPAN></P>
      <H3><SPAN class=text><B>Basic Techniques of Sheet Mulching</B></SPAN></H3>
      <P><SPAN class=text>Once you get the hang of it, sheet mulching can be 
      used anywhere plants are grown in the ground. Sheet mulching may be used 
      either in establishing a new garden or tree planting, or to enrich 
      existing plantings. In both cases, mulch is applied to bare soil or on top 
      of weeds. New plantings are planted through the mulch, and a small area is 
      left open to accommodate established plants and trees.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN class=text>The benefits of mulching justify putting the energy 
      into doing the job right, using ample materials. Collect all of the 
      materials (as outlined below), and complete the mulching process in a day. 
      A reduction in maintenance and increase in plant vigor will reward the 
      initial effort.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN class=text>Sheet mulch is put down in layers to mimic natural 
      forest mulch: well decayed compost, weed barrier, partly decayed compost 
      and raw organic matter.</SPAN></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></H3>

      mulch</STRONG></SPAN></FONT></H1>
      <H3><FONT size=3><SPAN class=text><STRONG>Step 1: The Concentrated Compost 
      Layer</STRONG></SPAN></FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT size=3><SPAN class=text>To prepare the site, knock down tall 
      weeds and woody plants with a brush cutter, scythe, or simply by trampling 
      the area. Then proceed to lay down the sheet mulch.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3><SPAN class=text>Whether you are mulching bare soil or 
      weeds, the first step is to "jump start" microbial activity by adding 
      enriched compost, poultry or stock manure, worm castings or the like at 
      the rate of about 50 lbs/100 square feet. This high nitrogen matter 
      stimulates soil life and gets things going. If the soil is acid, which it 
      likely is if the area has been disturbed recently and treated with 
      conventional fertilizers, add a layer of lime or crushed coral. A soil 
      analysis will indicate the need for adjustment of pH or mineral 
      amendments. This is the appropriate time to add the recommended doses of 
      amendments such as rock phosphate and K mag.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=3><SPAN class=text>Soak the area well with water when the 
      amendments are dispersed.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <H3><FONT size=3><SPAN class=text><STRONG>Step 2: The Weed 
        Barrier</STRONG></SPAN></FONT></H3>
        <P><FONT size=3><SPAN class=text>Most cultivated areas today harbor 
        untold numbers of weed seeds. There are also weed seeds carried around 
        by wind, animals and people. Soil borne seeds are lying dormant and 
        waiting for the right conditions to sprout. Simply pulling or killing 
        growing weeds will not erase the weed problem: more seeds will sprout 
        almost as soon as the soil is exposed to moisture and light. Therefore 
        the next step in mulching is to put down an organic <I>weed barrier. 
        </I>This barrier prevents the germination and eventual emergence of 
        weeds through your mulch.</SPAN></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT size=3><SPAN class=text>Underneath this weed barrier grasses 
        and weeds die and quickly become food for earthworms. From now on, the 
        worms turn and aerate the soil, as they do naturally when in the right 
        environment.</SPAN></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT size=3><SPAN class=text>Of the four sheet mulch layers, the 
        weed barrier has no natural counterpart on the forest floor. In the 
        forest, weeds do not sprout because there is "no room for them," which 
        simply means a lack of space above and below the ground, and a lack of 
        light. By planting an area properly, there will eventually be no room 
        for weeds. The weed barrier is needed only for establishment of the 
        mulch, and disappears with time. If your area is planted appropriately, 
        weeds will not emerge after the decomposition of the weed 
        barrier.</SPAN></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT size=3><SPAN class=text>Materials for the weed barrier that 
        work well are: 4-6 sheets of newspaper, cardboard, burlap bags, old rugs 
        of natural fiber, worn-out jeans, gypsum board, or whatever you can find 
        around. Banana, ape and ti leaves also work if laid down in several 
        layers. Overlap the pieces of the material so as to <I>completely cover 
        the ground without any breaks,</I> except where there are plants you 
        want to save. Around these leave a generous opening for air circulation 
        around the root crown. Care in laying down the weed barrier will save 
        you the headache of emerging weeds later 
on.</SPAN></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H3><FONT size=3><SPAN class=text><STRONG>Step 3: The Compost 
      Layer</STRONG></SPAN></FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT size=3><SPAN class=text>This layer is on top of the weed barrier 
      - <I>it must be weed seed free.</I> Well conditioned compost, grass 
      clippings, seaweed and leaves are ideal materials to spread over the weed 
      barrier. Any weed-free material mixture at the right moisture level for a 
      good compost will do. This should form a fairly dense layer about 3 inches 
      thick.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <H3><FONT size=3><SPAN class=text><STRONG>Step 4: The Top 
        Layer</STRONG></SPAN></FONT></H3>
        <P><FONT size=3><SPAN class=text>The top dressing mimics the newly 
        fallen organic matter of the forest. It also must be weed-free. Good 
        materials for this include leaves, twigs and small branches, fern or 
        palm fronds, straw, coffee chaff, macadamia nut shells, wood chips, 
        sawdust, bark, etc.. The top layer will slowly decompose into lower 
        layers, and therefore must be replaced periodically; it represents 
        reserves of compost. This layer should be about 3-5 inches deep. Many 
        materials suitable for the top layer often have a pleasant cosmetic 
        appearance. What luck! For this reason, there should be no hesitation in 
        using sheet mulch in all cultivation from landscaping to gardening to 
        permanent orchard crops. In fact, as you use mulch, bare soil will begin 
        to seem ugly and undesirable.</SPAN></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT size=3><SPAN class=text>When the soil is amended and sheet 
        mulch applied properly, there will never be a need to turn the soil. 
        Earthworms do the tilling. The only task left will be to keep the soil 
        covered by replenishing the mulch.</SPAN></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR>

      it and will destroy both your work and your

      <H2><SPAN class=text><B>Mulching Around Trees</B></SPAN></H2>
      <P><SPAN class=text>1) Plant tree.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN class=text>2) Amend soil around tree in a wide ring shape from a 
      few centimeters from trunk out to 1 meter (3 feet) with a light layer of 
      nitrogen fertilizer, such as chicken manure, and other amendments if 
      necessary. Rake or water in.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN class=text>3) Spread a layer of permeable weed barrier around the 
      tree in a ring shape, leaving about 15 cm (6 inches) diameter around the 
      trunk of the tree for it to "breathe." Make certain there are no gaps in 
      the ring shape through which weeds can emerge. Water the weed barrier 
      layer thoroughly before the next step.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN class=text>4) Spread compost and/or mulch about 15 cm (6 inches) 
      thick over the weed barrier, again making sure it is several centimeters 
      away from the trunk of the plant.</SPAN></P>
      <H2><SPAN class=text><B>The Ongoing Process</B></SPAN></H2>
      <P><SPAN class=text>To make mulching as efficient and easy as possible, 
      use mulch materials which are readily available. With good planning, 
      mulching of gardens and orchards can become a regular part of 
      maintenance-just mulch with handy materials such as grass clippings, plant 
      prunings (chipped or roughly chopped), animal bedding, etc.. Eventually, 
      other tasks such as watering, fertilization and weeding will be reduced. 
      The overall maintenance burden in mulched conditions, when properly 
      executed, is far less than in conventional systems.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN class=text>Once a plant is properly mulched, its own leaf drop 
      will constantly add to that mulch. But is natural leaf drop enough to 
      maintain the mulch? The answer to this depends on the plant species and 
      also how the plant is growing in relation to other plants. Certain trees 
      produce tremendous amounts of leaf matter which decomposes rather slowly; 
      examples are: avocado, macadamia, lychee, as well as many others. These 
      trees can be expected to generate sufficient mulch for themselves once 
      vigorous growth is attained. Unfortunately, under most conditions many 
      trees do not create enough long lasting mulch for maintenance of their 
      needs. To explain this apparent deficiency, look once again at the forest. 
      Here, plants are "stacked" in the vertical direction in ground-level, 
      middle, and tall vegetation. This means that the ground under each plant 
      receives organic matter from several plants.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN class=text>There are many ways to produce sufficient mulch at 
      your site. Grass clippings, for example, represent nutrient rich mulch 
      material. Deep rooted, vigorous growing plants that readily come back from 
      hard pruning or coppicing will also work. There are several nitrogen 
      fixing trees which produce copious amounts of green matter. Each should be 
      evaluated for the specific site before planting. Other plants that work 
      well are kukui, hau, <I>desmodium,</I>, various bunch grasses (such as 
      Guinea grass), lemon grass, comfrey, etc.. Also, many water plants such as 
      water hyacinth are good mulch materials. Since plants that produce heavy 
      amounts of organic matter are by their nature nearly irrepressible, 
      extreme caution should be taken not to let these plants escape your 
      management and become weedy.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN class=text>Sheet mulching should not be confused with composting, 
      artificial weed barriers, or green manuring. Sheet mulching as described 
      here is quite different from these in that it seeks to recreate the 
      organic mulch layer of the forest with a minimum of effort from people. 
      Properly planned, a backyard or orchard system will produce its own raw 
      mulch in sufficient amounts and people are involved only in putting this 
      material back onto the ground where it belongs.</SPAN></P>
